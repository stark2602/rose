          "My love, my jaan, on this Rose Day,</br> I'm reminded of how your presence in my life is akin to the gentle beauty of a rose. Your essence colors my world with warmth and joy, much like the vibrant hues of a blooming rose. With each passing moment, my admiration for you grows, just as the petals of a rose unfold to reveal their inner beauty. Your love is the sweet fragrance that fills my heart, and I am endlessly grateful for the love and inspiration you bring into my life. Happy Rose Day, my dearest, may our love continue to bloom and flourish like the most exquisite rose in the garden of eternity.".
